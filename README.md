# CCGen

## Chinese Character Generator

I had a hard time finding a Chinese character worksheet generator (田字格字帖产生器/田字格字帖產生器) which supported custom fonts, so here we go.

Dependencies:

- Python 3.10
- fpdf2 (`pip install fpdf2`)

Run with `python ccgen.py <options> <character list>`

The code is public domain.
